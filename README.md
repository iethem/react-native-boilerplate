> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.

> This project uses __react-navigation__ for navigating between screens. The stack navigator can be found under the app/containers/App folder. For more information see https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/hello-react-navigation.html

## Generators

```Shell
npm run generate
```

Allows you to auto-generate boilerplate code for common parts of your
application, specifically `component`s, and `container`s. You can
also run `npm run generate <part>` to skip the first selection. (e.g. `npm run generate container`)
